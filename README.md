## Your Solution Setup and Run Instructions

Please include instructions on how to setup and run your solution here.

## Your Approach and Preparation

- As i had not coded in Ruby before, i had to learn the basics of Ruby and then implement the solution. This started with understanding the differences between Ruby and other languages i had worked with before, which is mostly JavaSript.
- Familiarised myself with FreeAgents values at https://engineering.freeagent.com/2018/11/30/writing-code-at-freeagent/.
- I decided to take my time with the test and treat it equally as a learning opportunity as well as a test of my skills.

## Your Design Decisions

- From reading the company values, there was an emphasis on functional and and well tested code. I decided to use a functional approach to the solution and also use TDD to ensure the code was well tested.
